General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\n\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.", "start_char_idx": 161555, "end_char_idx": 163333, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"8509cc26-bbba-4e57-b57e-83ac6b17916d": {"node_ids": ["b211a777-5fd9-4b79-a712-71c9c8b8ceec", "efcc8ba4-b140-41c6-8027-71892299c59d", "ccce415a-976b-43cc-a6a0-eeb87df997a5", "c5a7128a-616e-451a-9c52-cfc11926ad3d", "2a25b435-34a5-4069-b94a-98cfee467da6", "9a29d700-07d6-481d-a0ed-be91508ccd2d", "325c543a-09ac-4f08-88f8-b9466fd3c3ed", "efc12074-aa0c-4c5b-a307-791c83df8fba", "057568c5-5621-4d70-927e-d32e37c2f38a", "8c487083-e93e-4815-84a8-67cc7db6d306", "5ae16b9a-da36-4d4b-83bf-169cc8209d0d", "66c03e04-4eba-4175-a2b0-e459e1dba28d", "694a97e3-57f0-4b87-8d07-380712cbc1fb", "ed6120e5-47a2-47b9-95c1-7a8ba9d76a23", "32439a74-5c78-4000-bda5-1ba990b38e4e", "31a9089d-a0cd-44eb-a105-2dfc3e28cf3d", "7d6afb59-637d-420a-a328-83a0a982b5b3", "a08f5ffe-e96d-4efc-b0aa-a332458461cb", "f32b0ac9-4570-4c4f-bb76-6df070ff88c8", "895fdb9b-979f-4ee9-b9d2-86f735e142ac", "e2a0b062-c9bc-46b3-9d3d-238904926d9e", "baed2802-187d-44a6-bab5-4da9072053b3", "2f9c0452-6fa2-455f-af71-1e91b431e539", "08ecdc74-c15a-4394-9cc4-b886ca34b618", "f400016e-fec1-4954-ab59-84dfbf3c2b34", "7699006d-54a1-48ca-89cc-c9457317fe50", "1ca6459c-7fb7-4a65-91b3-8b0847c63b98", "b9342957-97d7-4803-9fc7-6b60e298c2a4", "e55c0e26-cc93-435d-bed6-fd0cc59e7738", "e1d9c43b-6df6-4307-a7bf-bdece4b229c5", "7dfc2d2b-c560-4646-a96c-aff29867ad2f", "12acb421-a349-482b-9338-db40fe6a0f10", "03a3026e-a9ef-4df7-a9fe-9ec8183f3d23", "c949fa20-7d64-49b8-9dfa-bdd972f120c5", "2bc2747b-2089-47b0-b490-cca377dbfe86", "c67a0227-ce21-4efe-a081-84bc9dae7286", "f80376a4-db6a-4c50-8f4a-b8a1b9fce850", "c1c9f29e-8d2e-4bb1-9562-b8e69dfe6b90", "b67d1433-c22d-4284-8566-82250ccd06c7", "b25dbd3e-169e-479a-bc9b-61b9391067f8", "6d711796-5a96-48d4-8597-8c0f989d0b7f", "f65a837f-7821-4862-90a5-d9f250beab59", "51227edf-3e05-4d74-aaa7-861a5176bee2", "2f5d7534-e5d9-41e5-be43-6efd78e2a217", "b312267a-1ca2-4aac-9db7-7da58b6f34fa", "72108c9d-f5ff-4f62-b92c-0cbdfc670fb2", "3c922bf6-e825-4084-b5ed-5ef1c49478c5", "94c0434e-ec86-4dc7-b488-74c3612ff263", "c6c06ebd-e1eb-46df-b6a1-3382958eba0a", "dd3fb7d8-de91-41de-bd8e-5bf9a8015d30", "dc4ec2a0-f3b2-419a-acc9-5c58b2e8dd8e", "a167cd23-e75a-49a4-9551-1a7ab513f641", "1013398f-8b48-4897-9365-eb49b43652e1", "ba009f7b-ae3c-4fc4-a0e9-c03c25813525", "3076d2ce-1838-4e70-a1f1-f58cce3c5236", "82a91455-742a-4ebb-b5e9-2a979edfdbf3", "3b661cc2-8578-4339-9aad-159bfc845117", "8ab5e75d-c254-4399-bb0e-96d84c48690a", "bb156a5f-3499-4422-b104-fc559d6fa011", "00b9bf11-58a5-410b-906f-c49d84e22928", "772facd1-7438-4bd9-8edb-149c16ed5a81", "b3391bc8-a27e-4de3-b044-1a3419b38302", "21e8462f-ac9e-4ead-8407-ba4ddb097d1d", "025fe66f-4df8-4453-bad3-17c702c84706", "ca8d6b27-8982-45d6-bd36-31594e333a27", "05323788-e4e3-4aed-86b8-e27c97b5f8c0", "9b6f5c8b-b98e-4ce3-b0f6-ee6f3fe18a3a", "b63e0716-9025-4cea-952f-4118918d521d", "dd4a518a-7dfd-4834-ab4c-699107a9bc3b", "83b8952b-a4e7-48ea-9198-7ff02d0f7a9b", "fafac21f-1b2d-4ffc-aa95-41999ffdbd8f", "5a15cae8-f528-49dd-afcc-cd0432a02683", "cf677a8f-7bce-45e2-a8fb-4abf1e1faf15", "835fb73f-627e-4aa9-9252-1bdac7a2221f", "7633bea3-f709-4b60-986a-e9be3ced3140", "ac7575d4-fbb5-4ee1-8d2b-97a713290c32", "b30ab7c4-d3d6-4816-b6dd-580fb3f6e2cc", "6b3041f4-38fe-4813-8aa4-7e8d9df075ff", "46afcdfe-2850-493a-967a-37987556c88d", "8d115e6d-bab8-46e5-a953-fb37a70ca9dd", "9659ba93-a8ab-48e0-bf90-9fae6a5a13bf", "5ae52069-85c2-4043-9fc1-41d90b544450", "f8be5979-5042-4467-b794-247999c59efb", "77c2cd1a-1240-4681-b219-a39ee35731f3", "5e2d9a0c-55fc-42a0-ac0a-b5822b24b4da", "d8458a6c-6ae1-48a6-a340-cdbaa33801f3", "761d45f6-8e91-4505-b67d-f3d78331086f", "e682dbba-16cc-4ce5-aced-d057aae6db37", "9bfa78f5-b3fd-4c3d-bbd2-04b07edd9535", "a82905ca-d201-4275-b891-a3a390966bb3", "3091e3ce-b6b7-4b7d-b529-01a5a389d840", "6451d164-866a-4bfa-8d3a-d7ebc747aed3", "8732aa84-2782-4782-be27-038d65a67542"], "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/ZaharA/projects/llama_index/books/alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_name": "alice_in_wonderland.md", "file_size": 170013, "creation_date": "2024-04-13", "last_modified_date": "2024-04-13"}}}}
